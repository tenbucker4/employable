Employable is a custom resume builder built in ReactJS. Users can edit and add personal information, education and work experience to a pre-formatted resume, which is automatically updated at the bottom of the page. Custom color themes can be selected and users can download their final resume as a PDF.

This project allowed me to get familiar with React class components and working with state and props.
